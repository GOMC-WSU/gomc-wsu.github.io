          We have given a number of workshops on how to use GOMC, two of which

          the fastest way to get up and running with GOMC.

        To support the use of GOMC for high throughput screening of metal 
        organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas adsorption and separation our team 
        has developed a tool to automatically generate the simulation input 
        files for more than 7000 MOFs, from structures found in the CoRE-MOFs 
        database.   To download the HTS tool, please refer to HTS repository 
        on GitHub.
